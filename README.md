# Art-Gallery-Database-Project

## Description
The Art Gallery Database Project using SQL, the backend involves designing and managing a relational database. Create tables for Artists, Artworks, Exhibitions, Sales, and Customers, defining columns with appropriate data types and constraints. Establish relationships using primary and foreign keys to link related data (e.g., ArtistID in the Artworks table references ArtistID in the Artists table).

Use SQL queries for CRUD operations: INSERT INTO for adding data, SELECT for retrieving data, UPDATE for modifying records, and DELETE for removing entries. Apply joins (e.g., INNER JOIN) to combine data from related tables.

Implement data validation through constraints like NOT NULL and UNIQUE to ensure data integrity. Consider using stored procedures for recurring tasks and triggers for automatic actions. Secure the database by defining user roles and permissions to control access. This setup ensures efficient data management and retrieval.
